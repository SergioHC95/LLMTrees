  "narrative": "Yeah I was in the boy scouts at the time. And we was doing the 50-yard dash racing but we was at the pier marked off and so we was doing the 50-yard dash. There was about 8 or 9 of us you know, going down, coming back. And going down the third time I caught cramps and I started yelling \"Help!\" but the fellows didn't believe me you know. They thought I was just trying to catch up because I was going on or slowing down. So all of them kept going. They leave me. And so I started going down. Scoutmaster was up there. He was watching me. But he didn't pay me no attention either. And for no reason at all there was another guy who had just walked up that minute... He just jumped over and grabbed me.",
