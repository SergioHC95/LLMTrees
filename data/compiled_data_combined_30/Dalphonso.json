His name was Ron and uh they had a falling out the parents, because their dog bit Marina and they didn't talk after that incident. So they didn't talk for a couple – for a lot of years. Years. Decades at least. So you know, my father died unexpectedly and Ron was in surgery on his knee in the hospital the same day my father died actually, the same month. Well we don't know for certain if it was the same time. But – when he woke up from his surgery he said to his wife Lenore who was also my mother's best friend he said \"Len, I had a dream, that Mike came to me, and said 'Let bygones be bygones.

He came to the hospital – I mean to the funeral on crutches because he was so freaked out by it He was really quite hysterical.",
