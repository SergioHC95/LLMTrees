    "narrative": "Well, I was at work one day and I was doing my usual job - working on the warehouse floor, stocking boxes and organizing merchandise. I had been working for a few hours and it was getting late. I had been feeling a bit strange, a bit lightheaded, but chalked it up to hunger and not having eaten yet that day. But then, as I was walking around the warehouse returning items to their proper places, I started to feel a strange tightness and pressure in my chest. I stopped what I was doing and leaned against a nearby wall for a bit, but the pressure only got stronger. And I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. Next thing I know, I started seeing spots and I could feel sweat dripping down my forehead and my arms. I tried to take some deep breaths, but I just couldn't catch my breath. I was really scared and didn't know what to do. Suddenly I heard a voice coming from across the warehouse. It was the manager, who had seen me and called out to me - it seems someone had noticed me and was checking to see if I was alright. I tried to yell back that something was wrong, but I couldn't find my voice. The manager started walking towards me and I could feel my world going dark. I started to drop to the ground, but luckily the manager got to me in time and caught me just before my legs gave out. He took me to the staff room and sat me down in a chair. He asked me questions about what was wrong and what happened. He got me a glass of cold water and told me to rest for a bit. After a few minutes, the pressure in my chest slowly eased up and I started to feel better. It turned out I had been having a panic attack, but I escaped from the situation with the help of the quick action of the manager. It was never a fun experience, but it really could have been much worse, and it taught me to check in with myself and make sure to properly rest and eat to avoid further episodes.",
